    <p class="project2">I have a strong interest in IoT and automation, which led me to develop<br> a Smart Food Dispenser for Birds. Using ESP32, I designed a system that automatically dispenses food based on a set schedule or sensor-based detection. This project aimed to provide a reliable and efficient feeding solution for birds, combining technology with real-world problem-solving</p>

    <p class="project3">Currently, I am working on a Facial Emotion Detection System that leverages AI and Computer Vision to analyze facial expressions. This system recommends movies, music, and motivational quotes based on the user's mood, making it a personalized and engaging experience. Through this project, I am enhancing my knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, while also exploring the potential of AI-driven recommendations.</p>
